**Due to issues with storing unity data on GitHub a zipped version of the project has been placed on dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/s/uf5h6os7dhnrrm7/ChiroChroma.zip?dl=0), this is the one that should be downloaded in order to test or use it.**

Latest builds can be found in the lastBuild Folder.

There is a Feedback program where game data can be loaded. Game data is stored in the Data folder.

There is a Settings program where settings for in game can be set. By clicking apply these are stored in a temporary file, which can be loaded in game by pressing "l".

Lastly there is the game itself which can be run.
